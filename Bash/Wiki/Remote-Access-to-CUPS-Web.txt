If you have a server(without gnome or kde running) and need to install a printer, the easiest way is to use the CUPS web interface. You can see it on your own ubuntu computer by going to http://localhost:631/admin. But to get to this page remotely for a server, you need to first make some edits to the cups conf file. So do the following:

## 1. Edit the cups configuration file by first running the following command on your server:

    sudo nano /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

## 2. Your first edit to the file is to make the section that looks like:

    "Only listen for connections from the local machine."
    
    Listen localhost:631
    
    Listen /var/run/cups/cups.sock

look like this:

    "Only listen for connections from the local machine."

    Port 631
    
    Listen /var/run/cups/cups.sock

## 3. You then want to change the sections that looks like this:

    < Location / >
    # Restrict access to the server...
    Order allow,deny
    < /Location >
    < Location /admin >
    # Restrict access to the admin pages...
    Order allow,deny
    < /Location >
    < Location /admin/conf >
    AuthType Default
    Require user @SYSTEM
    # Restrict access to the configuration files...
    Order allow,deny
    < /Location >

so they look like this:

    < Location / >
    # Restrict access to the server...
    Order allow,deny
    Allow all
    < /Location >
    < Location /admin >
    # Restrict access to the admin pages...
    Order allow,deny
    Allow all
    < /Location >
    < Location /admin/conf >
    AuthType Default
    Require user @SYSTEM
    # Restrict access to the configuration files...
    Order allow,deny
    Allow all
    < /Location >

## 4. Finally, restart cups with the following:

    sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart

## 5. You should now be able to log into cups on your server with:

    http://yourserverip:631

Note that when you change something, it may tell you that you need to add a certificate to firefox. Do so 

by clicking the add/get certificate button at the bottom of the firefox error message page. It will also 

tell you that to change stuff, you need to use the "https" version of the page instead of "http" so just 

go to:

    https://yourserverip:631

You might also have to open/port forward port 631.
